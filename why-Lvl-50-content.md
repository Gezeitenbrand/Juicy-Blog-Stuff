# Why we need Lvl. 50 content for the Power Platform

There is much beginner-friendly material out there explaining how to start with the Power Platform. There is material of any kind describing to you functions, flows, connectors, and how to create your first app, or flow, or dashboard, or even your first bot. This Lvl. 100 content is a great starting point to get going with the Power Platform.

But in real life, not as many people can experiment with building their solutions as we'd like to.

Even with Level 100 content, we overwhelm users. Most people don’t start with www.make.powerapps.com and ‘hello world”, but with wondering about licenses and begging their IT departments to be allowed to play around with Power Platform tools. There is a gap between what we think what they could do and what they really can do. 

It is time to lower those barriers and make it easier for them to get started. 

# How do those barriers look like?

There are many different things that keep users from starting with the Power Platform. Most people who feel want to start, do so at their workplace. There are few users who actually start out from their private accounts, therefor I want to focus on business user. That doesn't mean that the solutions I'm going to describe don't apply for private user as well. 
Let's have a look at possible barriers user face day to day when it comes to the Power Platform:

## You don't know if you have a license
Quite often user have no idea, whether they have the right license to start, or not. And most user don't have access to the Microsoft 365 admin center to check their licenses either. But you can simply check if you license includes Power Platform apps by yourself. Just go to www.office.com and sign in with your work account. Then click on *all apps* and check, if you can find Power Automate, Power Apps, Power Virtual Agent or Power BI.
If you can find them, you do have a license. If you can't find them, that could mean, that your license includes those apps but the IT decided to limit your access or you don't have the right license. Since most license include at least a limited access to the Power Platform, most likely it's due to corporate policy that the IT limited your access. 

## You don't get the licences/access
Since most organizations have E3 or E5 licenses (and bot give you limited access to the Power Platform), it's most likely, that somebody in your organization decided to limit your access to the apps. Quite often there are several reasons for that:

- Lack of information
Let's face it, most people in classic IT departments have a lot of things to do. And learning a whole new stack of software that's build around automation is usually not the     highest priority. If IT people want to automate tasks, they already have their tools, like PowerShell, Logik Apps or simply a coding language. They don't have the need for a     low-/no-code solution to learn. And most of them don't see, why the business has the need to do that. Many people simply struggle to understand the why and understand the usecase. And in order to empower the business, you need to learn it yourself first. But you don't learn it, if you don't know why you should in the first place.

- Insecurity about usage
From lack of information how and why to use the Power Platform comes insecurity about this whole thing work and how the different solutions interact with each other. The job of the IT is it, to make everything run smoothly. The last thing you need is a user who's starting interacting with your perfectly running environment, right? If you don't know how something works, you'll have a hard time giving permissions to others. Because you can't help out in an emergency. And you don't see the necessity in the first place.

- Fear of breaking something / data leakage
From insecurity about usage comes the fear that the user may break a perfectly running system. Most IT people know about/have created an infinite loop while learning how to code. You don't want user to accidentally create something like this in your production environment. 
Additionally there is the fear of data leakage. A lot of flows use interaction with social media platforms as example for automation. Accidentally tweeting the biggest company secrets, and doing it automatically, doesn't sound very enticing. The idea that the user is being able to perform tasks automatically, without thinking of it, makes people quite nervous. 

## You don't have the time or opportunity 
You have a lot of things to do in your regular job. Do you have sparetime to dig into something like the Power Platform? Most of us are working crazy hours anyway and learning something new can be exhausting and often feels like an additional task. Even if it provides a simple method to create, automate or analyse data, thus making your daily work easier, it can be a lot.

## Organization is still on prem



All those reasons usually come from an (old-fashioned) organizational culture in which there is a gap between the IT- and the business departments. There is no collaboration but instead a climate of working against each other. 
"IT puts obstacles in my way and thus makes my daily work much more difficult"
"The user is constantly coming up with requests or problems that we need to fix because they don't understand how our system works"
Does that sound familiar? 
Limiting user access to IT system seems to be the easiest way to fix this issue. But this results in 
- leaving the user ignorant and thus ensuring that users will always do things wrong. 
- only IT people using the Power Platform, leaving the question why user need access to it after all.
- learning content that leaves the user clueless how to start, since they don't have access at all.

In the end, this will only deepen the gap between IT and business and lead to frustration on all sides. This undermines the idea of empower every person and every organization in the first place.

--> We need to explain the business need to IT and BDM
--> there we need to build up experience to enhace our arguments

--> that will help to unify IT and business and lower the culture of trust issues.
