# Accessibility

## Introduction

## Reasons why we don’t think about accessibility and inclusion
When thinking about inclusion and accessibility, we often think about a certain group of people that may be excluded. But quite often the actual group of people is far bigger, than we anticipate. 
Quite often we read and transport values like “included everybody”, “sharing is caring”, “we’re all in this together” and most of the people don’t want to be excluding on purpose. But there can be a gap between wanting to be inclusive and knowing what’s necessary to being it. 
Often it is a trade-off, between effort and benefit. As I have already explained, many people do not know what they can do, i.e. how great the effort really is. And when we turn to the benefit, we must of course be able to assess how great it really is. How many people would benefit, if we design our app, our article, our report inclusive, etc inclusive and accessible? 
While writing this I catch myself thinking “Is it worth it?” and I scare myself. Do I only want to include people, if I have a benefit from it? Don’t I want to be accessible because it’s the right thing to do? No matter how many people benefit from it? 

Let that question sink in.

Now let’s talk about those barriers we might face while thinking about inclusion and accessibility. Let’s see what we can do to design more accessible stuff, how much work it is and what our target group actually looks like.
After we know all that, let’s have a closer look of the benefits, what we might get out of it.

When thinking about inclusion and accessibility, most people think about certain disabilities like blind-, deaf- and people in wheelchairs. Nothing wrong with that, but there are two aspects you have to make yourself clear:
1.	Still many people don’t know what they can do to include people with such disabilities.
2.	The target audience is much, much larger than most people imagine.

## What do I need to do?

## Who is affected when we build poorly accessible STUFF?

## What do I get out of it?
- Doing the right thing		
- Better product
- Larger market
- More people involved than you think.


**Text blocks and things to include?**
Iceberg model 
The first step in breaking down exclusionary design principles is recognizing that they exist. When recognition occurs, progress is possible.
Exclusion often happens unintentionally.
Inclusion is a crucial element in how we design anything in the business context: Power Point slides, apps, articles, reports and many more.
