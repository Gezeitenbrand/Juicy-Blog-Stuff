There are some requirements to get started with the Power Platform

- You don't have a valid licence
- There are licences in your company, but you don't get one
- You don't have an environment in which you can start building apps and flows
- You don't get access rights
- Your company is still onprem and doesn't use cloud solutions
- You don't have the time or opportunity to get started

So you see, before you can actually start watching tutorials, dig into the Microsoft Learn paths and follow 
Power Platform Gurus on the socials, you need to consider a few things, hardly one ever talks about

Actually there is one other thing there is to consider, if you want to play around with Dataverse, but I will 
cover that later
