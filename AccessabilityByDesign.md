# Accessibility by design

## Introduction
In the last time I talked a lot to people about inclusion and diversity. The tech community in general is very divers and does a lot to include people from different backgrounds whatsoever. But I realized that the inclusion topic is much bigger than I realized. I learned that many more people are affected than I ever thought. 
At the same time, I talked to many people and there was a unanimous statement "We don't want to exclude anyone!". That's very good, of course, but when you get to the bottom of the statement and ask what is being done to actively include people from different backgrounds, the discussion often becomes difficult. Many people want to actively live inclusion, but don't know how. 

When we think of an accessible workplace, we often think of ramps, wide doors, and elevators. Few, however, think about what they produce at work every day: Documents, presentations, images. All this wonderful content is not too accessible for many people, as one would like it to be. 

That's why I think it's important to talk about the topic of "accessibility by design." 

Let's take a step together towards a more accessible world.

## Reasons why we don’t think about accessibility and inclusion / Our mental model
When thinking about inclusion and accessibility, we often think about a certain group of people that may be excluded. But quite often the actual group of people is far bigger, than we anticipate. 
Quite often we read and transport values like “include everybody”, “sharing is caring”, “we’re all in this together” and most of the people don’t want to be excluding on purpose. But there can be a gap between wanting to be inclusive and knowing what’s necessary to being it. 

Often it is a trade-off, between effort and benefit. As I have already explained, many people do not know what they can do, i.e. how great the effort really is. And when we turn to the benefit, we must of course be able to assess how great it really is. How many people would benefit, if we design our app, our article, our report inclusive and accessible? 
While writing this I catch myself thinking “Is it worth it?” and I scare myself. The question of whether it is worthwhile should never be decisive, but it often is.
Do I only want to include people, if I have a benefit from it? Or do I want to be accessible because it’s the right thing to do, no matter how many people benefit from it? 

Most of us live privileged lives with a good education, a safe home, access to resources, a job, and to other people. We are so privileged that we can afford to take care of everyone.
In my opinion, this leads to a moral duty to do so!

Now let’s first talk about who is actually affected when we go for poorly accessible design and why that may be a barrier we face while thinking about inclusion and accessibility. Let’s then see what we can do to design more accessible stuff, how much work it is and what our target group actually looks like.
After we know all that, let’s have a closer look of the benefits, what we might get out of it.

## Who is affected when we go for poorly accessible design?
When we start to think about accessability we tend to start thinking about physical limitations. We all know people who are using a wheelchair, who maybe blind or deaf or who are missing limps like a hand, an arm or a leg. 

We all can see and recognize those things easily, that's why they come to mind first. But actually there are far, far more things, we should think about.
- There are **physical impairments** that you can not recognize well, like a poor vision, motor impairment or challenges that affect your hearing. Just because you can't regonize them easily, doesn't mean that those don't impact peoples life and behaviour.
- We all know a lot of **mental conditions** that have a huge impact on your behaviour. Anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder or dislexia to name just a few of far over 200 different conditions that affect your behaviour. Once again, you can't detect those conditions that easy but they have a massive effect on peoples life. 
- Even if people are not diagnosed, that doesn't mean that they can be affected. Many of these can also be **temporary affections**. If you lack sleep your eyesight may suffer, if you're dehydrated you may find it difficult to focus on certain type of fonts. If you're calming your baby you maybe realize how hard it is to complete even simple tasks with just one free hand. 

Maybe all those examples give you an idea, that quite often you have no idea, who maybe affected from challenges in the daily live and that the target audience for accessible design is far bigger than we anticipated in the beginning. 


## What can we do?
The first step of using accessible design is to recognize that there is a need to. Period.
Once there is realization, progress can occur, but it always starts with recognition first.

The second step is to spread the idea. Not telling people to do it, or asking people to do it. Nor to claim that it is necessary. It's not about arguing, it's about spreading the idea that there is a need. The idea can grow if it meets the right mindset. Instead of telling people what to do and what not, it is important to appeal to their mindset. If we can set the core idea about include everybody and sharing is caring into the mindset of people, the following steps will be a lot easier. I will give you an example later on, check the iceberg model for further explanation.

Do you want to do more than realizing that there is the need? I recommend two things:
1. Take the [Accessibility fundamentals learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/accessibility-fundamentals/) provided by [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/).
2. Start using the Accessability tools like the [Accessability Checker](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/improve-accessibility-with-the-accessibility-checker-a16f6de0-2f39-4a2b-8bd8-5ad801426c7f) or [descriptive text for pictures](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/everything-you-need-to-know-to-write-effective-alt-text-df98f884-ca3d-456c-807b-1a1fa82f5dc2).
3. Switch on the grammar settings in Word for inclusiveness to become more aware of the language you use. ![Showing the grammer settings in Word for inclusiveness](/media/blob/main/Word%20Options.png)

It's super simple and an easy thing to do and maybe you can make someones life so much easier or give the possibility to work with your product after all. 

Once you started you can include the thought of accessibility in more areas of your worklife. Get inspiration from the article [10 Habits to create accessible content](https://blogs.microsoft.com/accessibility/10-habits-to-create-accessible-content/) or include the idea of accessible content in your company by discussing the [Accessability Evolution Model](https://blogs.microsoft.com/accessibility/accessibility-evolution-model/).

Many people think the effort is very high, because we tend to think in patterns, like "we have to build ramps and wider doors and how can we include deaf people?!". But in reality the thing starts somewhere else:
1. Realizing that you can do small and easy baby steps
2. Embracing the fact that far more people are affected than you actually might think.


## What are the benefits of accessible design?
After we've seen how little steps can have a huge effect and that this effect can impact a lot of people, let's have a quick look on the benefits from choosing accessible design. 

First of all you're doing a good thing. Thinking about others. It doesn't feel good to be excluded. Psychologists even argue, that rejection or feeling exluded is processed in your brain the same way, as if you get hurt physically. It hurts to feel excluded and that leads to feeling sad and angry. One step further, feeling excluded can reduce self-esteem, the sense of control and even the sense of being able to contribute something meaningful.

Apart from that you are making a better product. If it's an app, a piece of code or a Power Point presentation, it will be better in the end, because it is more complete. It's more versatile and more people can have access to it.

That leads to a bigger target audience and a bigger market. And that means, that more people are able to use or buy your product or can contribute by giving you feedback and evolve your product even further.

## Iceberg model
I mentioned earlier, that a good approach may be to remind people of their mental model. Many people believe in values expressed in slogans like "include everybody" or "sharing is caring". Quite often people are driven by their mental model more than they realize. If you want people to think about their behavior and change it, it can often be helpful to keep that thought in mind. Instead of telling people what to do differently, start with the mental model. If that aligns with an accessability idea, the necessary steps will follow much more easily. There is the possibility to use the iceberg model for that [explanation of the iceberg model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/community/why-m365-adoption-projects-fail#the-iceberg-model) and I think it might be very helpful to analyze accessability by design with that model as a next step to get a clearer picture of what is happening right now.

## Conclusion
The first step of using accessible design is to recognize that there is a need to. Period.
Once there is realization, progress can occur, because exclusion often happens unintentionally. Exclusive design affets far more people than meets the eye and the effort to change it is actaully small. To make it easier for people to feel included and contribute to our efforts, especially in the workplace, thinking about accessability is an important first step.
